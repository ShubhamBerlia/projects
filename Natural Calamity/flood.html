          <h1>FLOOD</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Floods are among Earth's most common and most destructive natural
            hazards.

        <h2>What causes flood?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Excessive rain, a ruptured dam or levee, rapid melting of snow or ice,
          or even an unfortunately placed beaver dam can overwhelm a river,
          spreading over the adjacent land, called a floodplain. Coastal
          flooding occurs when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to surge
          inland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most floods take hours or even days to develop, giving residents time
          to prepare or evacuate. Others generate quickly and with little
          warning. So-called flash floods can be extremely dangerous, instantly
          turning a babbling brook or even a dry wash into rushing rapids that
          sweep everything in their path downstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate change is increasing the risk of floods worldwide,
          particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, because of its role in
          extreme weather events and rising seas. The increase in temperatures
          that accompanies global warming can contribute to hurricanes that move
          more slowly and drop more rain, funneling moisture into atmospheric
          rivers like the ones that led to heavy rains and flooding in
          California in early 2019.

          The states falling within the periphery of "India Flood Prone Areas"
          are West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Assam, Bihar, Gujrat,
          Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The intense monsoon rains from
          southwest causes rivers like Brahmaputra, Ganga, Yamuna etc. to swell
          their banks, which in turn floods the adjacent areas. Over the past
          few decades, central India has become familiar with precipitation
          events like torrential rains and flash floods. The major flood prone
          areas in India are the river banks and deltas of Ravi, Yamuna-Sahibi,
          Gandak, Sutlej, Ganga, Ghaggar, Kosi, Teesta, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi,
          Mahananda, Damodar, Godavari, Mayurakshi, Sabarmati and their
          tributaries.

          In the year 2013, Uttarakhand suffered from a major catastrophic
          natural disaster in the form of huge and deadly cloudbursts, causing
          flash floods in River Ganga. Sudden, heavy rains caused dangerous
          landslides in Uttrakhand, which killed thousands of people and
          thousands were reported missing. The death toll was estimated to be
          5,700. The flash floods and landslides continued for 4 days from 14 to
          17 June, 2013. More than 1,00,000 pilgrims were trapped in the valleys
          that led to the Kedarnath shrine. Today, Uttarakhand Flash Floods are
          considered the most disastrous floods in the history of India.
