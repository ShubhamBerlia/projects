          <p>
            A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or
            earth down a slope.

        <h2>What causes Landslides?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope
          movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The
          term "landslide" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls,
          topples, slides, spreads, and flows. These are further subdivided by
          the type of geologic material (bedrock, debris, or earth). Debris
          flows (commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls
          are examples of common landslide types.

        <p>
          The two regions most vulnerable to landslides are the Himalayas and
          the Western Ghats. The Himalayas mountain belt comprise of
          tectonically unstable younger geological formations subjected to
          severe seismic activity. The Western Ghats and nilgiris are
          geologically stable but have uplifted plateau margins influenced by
          neo- tectonic activity. Compared to Western Ghats region, the slides
          in the Himalayas region are huge and massive and in most cases the
          overburden along with the underlying litho logy is displaced during
          sliding particularly due to the seismic factor.

        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1998&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Affected Areas: </strong> Amboori, Kerela&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Number of deaths: </strong>40 people died in the incident</p>
        <p>
          Amboori landslide, one of the worst natural disasters of Kerala, had
          taken a toll of 38, besides exposing the vulnerability of the hilly
          state to such mishaps. The failed slope located in Kurisumalai hill,
          was fairly steep at 32° and was covered by overburden consisting of
          colluvial deposits, boulders and weathered rock. Its contact with the
          underlying migmatised garnet-Biotite gneiss and garnetiferous
          quartzofeldspathic gneiss was marked by a thin layer of lithomargic
          clay which represented a weak plane.
