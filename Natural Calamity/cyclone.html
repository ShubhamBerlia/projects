          <br />
          <p>
            Cyclones are violent Storms with an intense spiral and accompanied
            by strong winds and heavy rains. They are caused due to strong winds
            blowing around the central area having low atmospheric pressure.

        <h2>What causes cyclones?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          When water vaporizes, it absorbs heat from the surroundings. Water
          vapor rises in the atmosphere where it cools down. When water vapor
          changes back into liquid the heat is released into the atmosphere.
          This warms the air around it.<br /><br />The warm air tends to rise
          and causes a drop in the pressure. The air moves from surrounding
          high-pressure areas to the central low-pressure area. This cycle is
          repeated. The chain of events leads to the formation of very
          low-pressure system surrounded by with very high-speed winds. This
          weather condition is a cyclone.

          On average around 2 to 4 tropical cyclones impact India every year,
          while most of these tropical cyclones impact the east coast of Indian
          states of West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu. The West
          Coast of India is less prone to cyclones with one cyclone out of 2 to
          4 hits the west coast with majority of them attacking the state of
          Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala.

        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1999&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Affected Areas: </strong>It caused inundation in large areas
          along the coastline and destroyed the coastal districts such as
          Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Puri and Ganjam.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Number of deaths: </strong>It caused the deaths of about
          10,000 people, and heavy to extreme damage in its path of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Orissa cyclone in the year of 1999 was the strongest storm to hit
          the Indian coast and was also the strongest tropical cyclones that
          affected India.<br /><br />
          The cyclone struck the Odisha coast on 29th October 1999. This Super
          Cyclone is also known as Paradip Cyclone. It hit Odisha with wind
          speeds of up to 250 kmph.

        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1970&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Affected Areas: </strong>There was also widespread rain in
          West Bengal and southern Assam, damaging houses and crops in both
          states. The Cyclone is said to be one of the reasons for formation of
          Bangladesh.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Number of deaths: </strong>Over 45 percent of the population
          of 167,000 was killed in the most severely affected subdivision of
          Tazumuddin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the cyclone hit the modern day Bangladesh (formerly East
          Pakistan), the nearly 20-foot storm surge created by winds as high as
          225.3 kmph (140 mph) devastated countless offshore islands, wiping out
          entire villages and destroying crops and livestock.

          cyclone which crossed the coast near Diviseema in Krishna district in
          1977.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worst-affected areas were in the Krishna river delta. On the
          island of Diviseema, which was hit by a 6 m high storm surge, hundreds
          of bodies floated in the waters, and bodies bloated beyond recognition
          were consigned to mass pyres.
