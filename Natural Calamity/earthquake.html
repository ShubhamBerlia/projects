          <br />
          <p>
            An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting
            from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that
            creates seismic waves.

        <h2>What causes earthquake?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The entire Himalayan belt as well as the countryâ€™s north-eastern
          portion is prone to powerful earthquakes with magnitudes greater than
          8.0. The Indian plate is moving toward the Eurasian plate at a pace of
          roughly 50 mm per year, which is the primary cause of earthquakes in
          these areas.

        <p>
          The zones are distinguished using Modified Mercalli (MM) intensity,
          which evaluates the impact of earthquakes. However, the seismic zoning
          map was updated following the Killari earthquake in Maharashtra in
          1993. merging the low danger zone, or Seismic Zone I, with Seismic
          Zone II. Zone I is therefore excluded from the mapping.
