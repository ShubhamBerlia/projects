          <p>
            A cloudburst is an extreme amount of precipitation in a short period
            of time, sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder, which is capable
            of creating flood conditions.

        <h2>What causes cloudburst?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cloudbursts happen when drenched clouds are not able to cause rain
          because of the rising movement of the extremely hot current of air.
          Rather than falling down, raindrops get larger in dimension and are
          forced up because of the air current. Finally, they will be heavier to
          carry and fall down, directing to more rainfall than normal.
